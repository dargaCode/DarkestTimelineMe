# Darkest Timeline Me
<strong>Language: HTML/CSS/JS</strong>

This site lets users load a photo and match it up to an overlay of the Darkest Timeline goatee <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RbKaLsxS0o">from the show Community</a>.

I spent a full month on this project, and took a lot of time trying to improve my code to include classes and object-oriented design.

Everything’s built from scratch, and it was very satisfying to get all the events working properly. Some of the details like locking the image to the canvas frame, centering the zoom on the right part of the image, etc. took a surprising amount of work.

I’m pleased with the results though, and it makes me so happy to see seeing my facebook friends and strangers on reddit posting evil photos of themselves.
